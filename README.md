## Introduction

LeetCode is an online platform for practicing coding problems. I am currently working on solving problems from various categories like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and more. This repository is my daily coding log to track my progress and practice problem-solving skills.

Each folder contains a Python solution to a specific problem, and each file is named according to the problem number and name for easy navigation.
